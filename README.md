## Description:

Final project from the Udacity Front-end developer nanodegree. Develop a travel app.

## How to install?

This project requires Node.js to run, if you don't have Node.js you can download it at [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/ "https://nodejs.org/").

After installing Node.js it is required to install the npm packages, you can do this by running the command:

* npm install

Then there are a few commands for each mode of the project:

* npm start (this starts the express server on port 8081)
* npm run build-prod (production mode of WebPack)
* npm run build-dev (development mode of WebPack)

Before you run a project you can also execute test scripts using the command "npm run test".

For more information about each of the WebPack configurations you can check the webpack.dev.js or webpack.prod.js configuration files.

The demo link is installed using a Digital Ocean Droplet, more information about that [https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/nodejs/](here "https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/nodejs/").
